windows-dev-setup
=================

If you have to use Windows (e.g. for work) then you may as well try and make things a bit more tolerable. That includes using a package manager (well, 3 really), making Windows a bit more OSX like with [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/), and improving the console experience with [Cygwin](cygwin.com) (via [babun](https://github.com/babun/babun)).

Note that I'm really just putting this here as a placeholder for the future - I've not really tested any of this yet...

Installation
============

1. Clone this repo somewhere
2. Run `setup.ps1` as administrator using PowerShell
3. Open up babun
4. Navigate to wherever you cloned this repo (`c:\` is now `/cygdrive/c/`)
5. Run `./babun_install`
